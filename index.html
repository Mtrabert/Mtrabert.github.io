	<p>My name is Michael Trabert, I enjoy hanging out with my friends on the weekends. My favorite things to do besides hanging out is playing video games when i can on the weekend. When i grow up I want to become an engineer. Some life goals of mine are to buy my dream car, have kids, and buy a nice house.<p>
